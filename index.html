            <h1>PINK FLOYD</h1>
              <div class="line"></div>
                <p>Pink Floyd is one of the most successful bands in history. The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall, particularly, have been consistently hailed as some of the greatest albums ever created, not just financially. Band members changed over the years, their sound changed, and the band endured. With their incredible live shows and wildly imaginative albums, they have become known all over the world.Roger Waters, the album's chief songwriter, drew heavily on his own life to create Pink Floyd, the fictional protagonist in the album named after the band. Waters and Floyd both lost their fathers during World War II and had unhappy marriages.In addition, "Comfortably Numb" was inspired by Waters' experience taking a muscle relaxant in Philadelphia while battling hepatitis. </p>

          <h3>Dark Side Of The Moon</h3>
          <p>From the moment a heartbeat begins to the moment a heart stops, it is a concept album that takes listeners through various stages of human life. </p>

          <h3>The Wall</h3>
          <p>Pink Floyd released their eleventh studio album, The Wall, on 30 November 1979 on Harvest and Columbia Records. This is a rock opera about a jaded rock star who eventually isolates himself from society.  </p>

          <h3>Meddle</h3>
          <p> Having no material to work with or an idea of the album's direction, the band devised a series of novel experiments that ultimately inspired the signature track "Echoes". Storm Thorgerson explained that the cover represents an ear underwater; as with several other albums designed by Hipgnosis, he was disappointed in the final result. </p>
